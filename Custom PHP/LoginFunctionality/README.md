<h1>Login Functionality</h1>

This part of my custom build Apps just shows simple flow through account registration and login flow through a DB to pass data for anyone to create an account, sign in and hang out at their Dashboard. 

Took this from watching a YT course, followed on and customized it my own way, I might add the SimpleBlog project in here so people can add their own personalized blog in here.
